why is data looking weird

why are wrights not adding to 1?

consider random search or Bayesian optimization to limit grid search (like Shu suggests - suggesting limiting grid search though not explicitly suggesting how. By using either random search or Bayesian optimization, you avoid enumerating a huge grid of hyperparameter values and thus reduce computational overhead. In Shu et al. (2025), they mention “avoiding a large grid” by limiting how many λλ and κκ points they test. One approach is simply to pick a small, sensible grid (e.g., 5 values for λλ, 2–3 for κκ), or you can adopt random or Bayesian search to systematically explore the hyperparameter space in a more efficient way.)
