To do:
    to get the plots of out of sample state sequence and cumrets we can create a variable that we append each month with the predicitions
    check other hyperparms - avg over time, loop over different tests. rerurn cross val (after GPT have a look at it and )
    what historical data is cov computed on for the first days? 
    Understyand what the 6 year cross val length is needed for - we recross val every 6 months so why need 6 years for cross val? or is it initial cross val is 6 years with tining every 6M until trading starts?
    tracking error
    fsctor historical expected return short or long window? e.g. state 0 how far back we want to take mean?
    when you implement the hyperparms, make sure the hyperparm from HY1 is used first in Hy2 so no look forward
    consider doing the

Take all the BL code, take the documentation, and ask gpt to evaluate whether makes sense
