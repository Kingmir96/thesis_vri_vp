consider random search or Bayesian optimization to limit grid search (like Shu suggests - suggesting limiting grid search though not explicitly suggesting how. By using either random search or Bayesian optimization, you avoid enumerating a huge grid of hyperparameter values and thus reduce computational overhead. In Shu et al. (2025), they mention “avoiding a large grid” by limiting how many λλ and κκ points they test. One approach is simply to pick a small, sensible grid (e.g., 5 values for λλ, 2–3 for κκ), or you can adopt random or Bayesian search to systematically explore the hyperparameter space in a more efficient way.)

Can we improve the data. I think the 0 return days are fucking with the model

Is the return calculated correctly on mondays? I.e. is it trying to divide by sunday or friday?


for the validation rolling pre processing, make sure that you are looking backwards. i.e. not rolling 6 months forward and still use t+6mth to standardize first day


Make sure vlad does:
    Rolling covariance estimation
    The day after trades



Currently, my covariance is calculated with EWMA on a slice of 252 days. Maybe makes
