To do:
    USE THE QUARTER REBALANCE FILE IF IT WORKS. OTHERWISE DELETE AND TRY AGAIN
    New data
    Transaction costs
    Refit? Cross validate forward?
    How often rebalance? Right now there is new covariance every day, which could eat up returns when we implement transaction costs
    Read vlads code
    Risk free rate for sharpe
    Add function to check portfolio weights over time
    Need to rebalance the equal weight portfolio as we move forward in time (Shu does quartely)
    to get the plots of out of sample state sequence and cumrets we can create a variable that we append each month with the predicitions


Check:
    When we take the historical mean return for each state, is that the active return we are accessing?
    Which return do we feed the BL for market?
    make sure 2.5 delta


Take all the BL code, take the documentation, and ask gpt to evaluate whether makes sense
