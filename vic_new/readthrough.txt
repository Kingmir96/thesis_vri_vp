cross val function:
	Look at:
		val_size 252 days?
		fit_transform done the same on test portion?
		double check roll forward and min/max window length
		make the model.fit take active return as ret_ser instead and then remove manual calc of active ret. Make sure that no other place in the code does manual calc of active return

	Changes made:
		Now calculates in sampel active return by state by using market return by state and not avg across all
		Changed val_size to 6 years and intial train size to 8 years. also roll forward every 6 months instread (before it was based on the val_size)
